Clean up shitty column names.

User progress tracking. Cards seen, cards answered correctly, cards answered incorrectly. All as ratios.

I need to improve on the cards themselves. SQL update script.
Formatting: before/afters get rid of dashes and asterisks.
Since the cards are so open-ended, include on the front some pointers toward what we're looking for, leading questions.
